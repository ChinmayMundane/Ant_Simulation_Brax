# Ant Robot Simulation and Control with MuJoCo and Brax

This repo demonstrates the use of MuJoCo and Brax for simulating and controlling an Ant robot. It includes creating a basic simulation with random controls, replicating multiple Ant robots in a single environment, training a PPO control policy using Brax, and applying the trained policy in a MuJoCo simulation.


## Task Overview
- **Task 1(Basic Simulation)**: Simulate a single Ant robot in MuJoCo with random control inputs using the `mujoco.viewer`.
- **Task 2(Environment Replication)**: Create a function to replicate multiple Ant robots in a single MuJoCo model and simulate them with random controls.
- **Task 3(PPO Training)**: Train a control policy for the Ant using Brax's PPO implementation.
- **Task 4(Policy Visualization)**: Load the trained PPO policy and test it in a MuJoCo simulation.

## Usage

## Task 1: Single Ant Simulation

Run a simulation of a single Ant robot with random controls:
```bash
python3 ant_control.py
```
- Loads ant.xml and applies random control inputs for 10 seconds.
- Displays the simulation using mujoco.viewer.

## Task 2: Multiple Ant Environments

Replicate and simulate multiple Ant robots:

```bash
python3 multiple_ant_control.py

```
- Uses ant.xml by default (update to half_cheetah.xml or humanoid.xml if needed).
- Replicates 6 environments in a 2x3 grid with a separation of 3 units.
- Applies random controls to all robots.

## Task 3: PPO Training


Train a PPO policy for the Ant:
```bash
python3 ppo.py

```
- Trains the policy for 75M timesteps using Brax's Ant environment.
- Saves a plot of the training progress as training_progress.png.

###  5×10^7 steps (given by brax implementation)

###  7.5×10^7 steps

Based on these, 75M timesteps appears to be the best for the task of training a control policy using Brax' PPO implementation because:

- It achieves the highest maximum reward (approximately 5900)
- It demonstrates better long-term stability after convergence
- It shows faster initial learning (steeper slope in the early phase)

Even after some performance decline, it maintains a higher final reward than either of the other runs.

## Task 4: Visualize Trained Policy


Test the trained PPO policy in MuJoCo:
```bash
python3 visualize.py
```
[4.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/785d5814-d6f6-4ae8-bf41-d43eeccebc7a)


- Saves and loads the trained policy from ant_ppo_policy.
- Applies it to the Ant in ant.xml and visualizes the rollout.
